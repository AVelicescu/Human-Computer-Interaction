                Grigore Jenica, a 58-year-old retired teacher who enjoys leisurely travel and
                cooking. Grigore prefers a slow-paced travel style, but her medium engagement
                with travel apps means she might use them half the time. She values clear navigation
                and detailed information but can sometimes feel overwhelmed by too many options.
                Despite her occasional use, Grigore relies on apps for trip planning and tracking
                visited places. Her main goals are to stay healthy and travel with her grandchildren,
                seeking authentic experiences over app ratings.

                Calinescu Yamandi, a 45-year-old unemployed football enthusiast whose limited budget
                and waning interest in travel apps present challenges. Cali prioritizes supporting
                his favorite team with friends but finds little motivation to use travel apps due to
                financial constraints and a decreasing interest in travel. He occasionally seeks
                budget-friendly options for stadium visits but often feels discouraged by high prices
                and sparse reviews. Despite his passion for football, Cali's engagement with travel
                apps remains minimal.
